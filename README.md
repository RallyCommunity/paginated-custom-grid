Paginated Custom Grid
===============

This is a modified Rally Custom Grid app using Rally's AppSDK 2.0RC3 and Web Services API v. 2.0. Please feel free to hack at and modify to meet your own needs.

Please use the App-uncompressed.html file from the deploy folder when using in Rally. Also, if you use Rally On-Premises, you will need to modify the URL's to meet your environment needs. The app loads by default so if you see no results, go to the settings and edit the app settings to make your selections.

Big Thanks to bearhart-rally and krmorse for their help and pairing!
